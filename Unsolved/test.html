            <p>
                Naruto Uzumaki is the son of the fourth Hokage(leader of the village),yet an orphan.
                As a newborn, his father and mother sacrificed themselves to save the village, the Village Hidden in the Leafs, so that way both their kid and the village can live a life.
                His father(Minato Uzumaki) used a technique called a jutsu. But this jutsu was a type of sealing technique, passed down through the Uzumaki Clan.
                This technique was called Eight Trigrams Sealing Style. He used this to seal Kuruma, better known as the Nine-Tailed beast, inside his own son.
